Install:
Download the latest zip or tarball archive using the Downloads button above, then unzip into your World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons folder.  You **must** then rename that default folder name from 'GabeStah-kAutoQuest-r1234675' to 'kAutoQuest'.  Failure to do so will cause World of Warcraft to not load the addon.

Usage:
kAutoQuest is a simple World of Warcraft addon that automatically accepts quests when opening dialog boxes with quest NPCs, and similarly will auto-accept quest rewards (when singular rewards are available).  If multiple rewards are available, kAutoQuest will wait for the user to select a reward manually.

Temporary Suppression:
To temporarily disable the auto-accept features of kAutoQuest, simply hold the "Shift" key while talking to any quest dialog NPC.
